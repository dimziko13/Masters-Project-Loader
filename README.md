# Masters Project Loader
The project contains only the loading functionality for the database due to lack of experience regarding the Web (working on it).
The SQL folder contains the 13 queries and the ER diagram of the database schema. 
The entities folder contain the hibernate classes mirroring the database.
The repo folder contain the interfaces.
Loading functionality is implemented in the LogImporter class.
